# Shoplifter

Shoplifter is a mod for [Stardew Valley](https://www.stardewvalley.net/) that allows the player to shoplift when the shopkeeper is not at the counter. 
Stock is randomly generated based on the save file and the current day for each shop. 
Only basic items will be available that are currently available to your character, it's unlikely you could get away with stealing a TV from Robin's (as she does point out...)

Ready for a spree of petty crime? Just don't get caught...

Any villager within 7 tiles of you when you shoplift will lose 2 hearts of friendship and if the shopkeeper or their family/employee catches you, 
you'll also receive a ban from the shop for the rest of the day.

You can only successfully shoplift once a day, you're not that bad are you?

Feel free to edit any of the strings included in the mod, I'm not the best at coming up with lines. Just make sure no entries are deleted.

The shops you can shoplift from are: Willy's Shop, Pierre's General Store, Carpenter, Marnie's Ranch, Harvey's Clinic, Saloon, Blacksmith. 
If you're wondering why all shops aren't included it's because the shopkeeper never leaves said store, you'll never get away with it.

The mod uses Harmony to patch some game methods.

Boring specifics are listed below:

Shop | Who can ban you | Stock exclusions

Willy's Shop | Willy | Any furniture, fish tanks, fishing rods
Pierre's General Store | Pierre, Caroline, Abigail | Recipes, wallpaper, flooring
